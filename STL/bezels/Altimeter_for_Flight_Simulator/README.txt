# Summary

Several options are available, with left or right knob, with one or two windows for kosslman and with barber pole indication below 10K feet or 16K feet.

I use several M3 screws and nuts. and small ones for knob, encoder and reinforcement.
A 3mm Axis and 2 brass tube, one 4 mm and the other 5 mm for the axis of the needles.
and a 2mm axis for auxliar gears.

I personally drill the holes of the gear biggers for the optical sensor, but only after mount everything. I glue the emiter an receiver of the sensor with hot-glue.

I get it from a old mouse, It is a diode and a photo-diode.

Motor is a 24BJY, it is small than 28BJY but same conections, it has 0.25 rpm and 4096 half-step by revolution. it cost more or less the same than 28BJY

You can conect to FS X via FS2Link, in this link there is the source code for the arduino:
